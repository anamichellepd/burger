# burger

The point of this app is to create a list of burgers and as the user "devours" a burger, it moves into the devoured list.

This has been especially hard because there were many errors in the instructions to begin with that were not clear or even doable.

Once the initial hurdle was tackled, then came errors we did not see in class such as the errors of files not being found. 

the config directory is in charge of setting up the connection and the formulas to read all, update or update just one.
the controllers file sets up the routes to connect the rest of the directories in the program. 

the database is where the schema and seeds are stored.  Once they are pulled into Workspace, the user should be able to modify it.
